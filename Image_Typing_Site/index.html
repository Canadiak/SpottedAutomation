            Everytime I FaceTime my bf he barely talks to me and he’s always napping. I tell him I want to ft and talk not just stay quiet and just stare at him. I try to start conversation but all he does is say one words or just gives me kisses and stuff. I wanna talk bc I’m feeling sad and I feel like I have no one to turn to bc he’s always napping on FaceTime or playing games on the computer. Even when he’s awake it still feels distant and I keep trying to start the convo. He gets upset when I don’t talk and serve him the same attitude he serves me. And then questions if I love him bc I’m being quiet like he does to me. It’s so frustrating I try to tell him i want to talk not just be chilling in silence. And when he does try to put in the effort he asks what I want to talk about and I talk but again, it’s like he shows little interest. I just wanna talk :(
