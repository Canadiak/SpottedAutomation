        <span id="text_span">im a brown girl and i dont judge people by their looks. it does not matter to me at all.  ive seen people who literally have no faces, accident victims and children with disabilties, who have the most beautiful souls.. i love them more than the  pretty face according to society's standard. at the end those faces will wither and turn to dust so why should they matter. those with good souls are leading much better lives than any superficial wannabe barbie.  also ive been told that im lacking inthe looks department by a lot of ppl my whole life, but idc because i know they cant change my face to make it better than how God has created it.    </div>
